# Tether.Rendering
Tether.Rendering is a module for the Tether library.
It includes many essential classes for rendering graphics.

# How to build
First, if you plan to use TETHER_RENDERING_VULKAN_API, the submodules VMA and shaderc should be cloned.

The shaderc submodule requires python3 to be installed for building.

This module also requires the Bin2cpp submodule.

Next, once you have all your dependencies, run cmake in the root repo directory, and there you have it!
